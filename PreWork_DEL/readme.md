# Interactive Full-Stack Project

As your first opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, this particular project will be a focal point of your portfolio. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job. That's why it is important for this project to be added to your portfolio.

## Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you've learned over the past eight weeks to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- Use React for the front end.
- Use PostgreSQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Have a folder structure that follows the separation of concerns design principle.
- Include authentication using JWT.
- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
- Be deployed using Render (with data).
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
- Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
- Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Presentation Requirements

Use this [Project Presentation Template](#) to address the following:

- **Elevator pitch**: A one-minute description of your application.
- **Concept**: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
- **Process**: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
- **Demo**: Show your stuff!
- **Directions for future development**.
- **Links** to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.

## Grading Requirements

This project is graded based on the following criteria:

> **Note**: If a project submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:

- A repository that has no code.
- A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else.
- A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else.


## Technical Acceptance Criteria: 25%
