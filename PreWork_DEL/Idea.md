## Features

### User Authentication
- User registration and login using email and password.
- JWT-based authentication for securing API requests.
- Password hashing with bcrypt.

### Weather Information
- Fetch current weather data and forecasts for user-selected locations using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Display detailed weather data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.

### Event Integration
- Use the Eventbrite API or Ticketmaster API to fetch upcoming events based on the userâ€™s location and preferences (e.g., concerts, workshops, or sports).
- Allow users to save and manage favorite events.

### Customizable Dashboard

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js for RESTful APIs.
- Middleware for logging (e.g., Morgan) and error handling.
- Use API keys to access third-party APIs securely.
- Environment variable management with dotenv.

### Database
- MongoDB (with Mongoose) for storing user data, saved cities, and event preferences.

### Frontend
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or a framework like React for a more modern approach).
- Use Axios or Fetch API to interact with the backend.

### API Integrations
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.
- Eventbrite API or Ticketmaster API for event data.
- SendGrid API (optional) for sending email updates.
- News API (bonus) for news headlines.

## Deployment
- Host the app on Heroku, Render, or Vercel.
- Use GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool for automated deployment.

## Key Features for API Keys

### Secure Storage
- Store API keys in environment variables (.env file).
- Do not expose keys in the frontend.

### Rate Limiting
- Use libraries like express-rate-limit to handle API rate limits.

### Dynamic Usage
- Allow users to search for locations/events dynamically, fetching data from APIs in real-time.
